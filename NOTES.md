# WSGI vs ASGI

**WSGI**

The Web Server Gateway Interface is a Python standard that allows for compatibility between web servers, frameworks, and applications. WSGI is good for traditional, synchronous web applications.

**ASGI**

The Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface is a calling convention that allows web servers to forward requests to asynchronous-capable Python frameworks and applications. ASGI is good for high-concurrency, asynchronous, and real-time applications.
